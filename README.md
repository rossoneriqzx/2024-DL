This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch. The model is designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and text summarization.

The Transformer model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention mechanisms to process and generate sequences. This implementation includes:

Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens and positions into dense vectors.

Attention Mechanism: Computes attention weights and applies them to values.

Encoder: Stacks multiple attention and feed-forward layers to encode the input sequence.

Decoder: Stacks multiple attention and feed-forward layers to decode the encoded sequence into the output sequence.

Transformer: Combines the encoder and decoder to form the complete model.

$Note$

This is an initial model that requires training data to be applied to actual tasks. To use this model:

1. Prepare your data: Collect and clean your dataset.

2. Preprocess the data: Convert text to token indices and apply any necessary preprocessing steps.

3. Train the model: Configure training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and train the model with your data.

4. Evaluate and optimize: Use a validation set to monitor performance and adjust the model as needed.

5. Deploy the model: Save the trained model and deploy it for your specific use case.
