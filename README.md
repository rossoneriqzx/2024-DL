This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch. The model is designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and text summarization.

The Transformer model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention mechanisms to process and generate sequences. This implementation includes:

Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens and positions into dense vectors.
Attention Mechanism: Computes attention weights and applies them to values.
Encoder: Stacks multiple attention and feed-forward layers to encode the input sequence.
Decoder: Stacks multiple attention and feed-forward layers to decode the encoded sequence into the output sequence.
Transformer: Combines the encoder and decoder to form the complete model.
